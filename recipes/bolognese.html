<h3>Description</h3>
Not so quick and easy meal, but it's just as good and you'll definitely take longer to make it than to eat it.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
<li>1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 medium sweet onion, diced</li>
<li>1 carrot, peeled and diced</li>
<li>1 celery rib, diced</li>
<li>¾ pound ground beef</li>
<li>¾ pound ground pork</li>
<li>4 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>¾ cups dry red wine</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
<li>1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
<li>1 pound pappardelle pasta</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol> 
<li>Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrot and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
<li>Add ground beef, ground pork, pancetta, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook until browned, about 5-8 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef and pork as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
<li>Stir in tomato paste, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, nutmeg and cinnamon until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>Stir in milk. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until reduced, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes. Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered and stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in parsley; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
<li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with bolognese sauce.</li>
</ol>
