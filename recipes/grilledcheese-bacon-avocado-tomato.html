<h3>Description</h3>
Not much to say. Just look at that thing!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
<li>2 slices of bacon</li>
<li>2 slices hearty white bread, such as Pepperidge Farm or Arnold</li>
<li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
<li>2 slices American or cheddar cheese</li>
<li>2 slices ripe beefsteak tomato </li>
<li>1/2 ripe avocado, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol> 
<li>Place bacon in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet and cook over medium-low heat, turning occasionally, until crisp all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and bacon fat to a small bowl.</li>
<li>Wipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Melt butter until foaming subsides. Add both bread slices and cook, swirling occasionally, until pale golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer to a cutting board toasted-side-up. Place one cheese slice on top of one slice, followed by bacon, tomato, and avocado. Top with second cheese slice and close sandwich. </li>
<li>Add half of reserved bacon fat to skillet and heat over medium-low heat. Add sandwich and cook, swirling occasionally, until deep, even golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sandwich using a flexible metal spatula. Add the remaining bacon fat. Return sandwich to skillet cooked-side up. Season with salt. Cook, swirling occasionally, until second side is deep, even golden brown and cheese is thoroughly melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately. </li>
</ol>
