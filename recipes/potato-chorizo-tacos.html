    <h3>Description</h3>
    Quick and easy meal! So good, you'll spend more time making the tacos then
    it takes to eat them!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound russet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 3 large potatoes)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh Mexican chorizo or vegan Mexican chorizo</li>
      <li>12 to 16 warm soft corn tortillas, for serving</li>
      <li>1 white onion, minced, for serving</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for serving</li>
      <li>Homemade or store-bought salsa verde, for serving</li>
      <li>2 limes cut into 8 wedges each, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Add
        vinegar and 2 tablespoons salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook
        until potatoes are just cooked through, about 5 minutes after coming to
        a boil. Drain potatoes and let rest over sink until mostly dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 4 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large nonstick or cast iron
        skillet over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add potatoes, shake
        to distribute around the pan, and cook, tossing and stirring
        occasionally until very crisp and golden brown on all sides, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a medium nonstick or cast iron skillet
        over high heat until shimmering. Add chorizo and cook, stirring, until
        heated through. Continue cooking, stirring and tossing frequently, until
        all the liquid has evaporated, some fat breaks out, the chorizo starts
        sizzling, and eventually is quite dry and well-browned, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cooked chorizo to pan with potatoes. Toss to combine and season
        to taste with salt. Serve chorizo and potato mixture immediately with
        tortillas, onions, cilantro, salsa, and limes on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
